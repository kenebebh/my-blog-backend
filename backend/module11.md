2. Endpoints and Resources:
   A list of all available endpoints (URLs) for interacting with the API.
   For each endpoint, details on:
   HTTP methods supported: (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
   Resource description: What data can be accessed or manipulated.
   Parameters: Required and optional parameters for requests, including their data types and descriptions.
   Example requests: Code snippets demonstrating how to make calls to the endpoint in various programming languages.
   Example responses: Sample JSON or XML responses with explanations of the data structure.

3. Authentication and Authorization:
   Methods for authenticating requests (e.g., API keys, OAuth).
   Details on how to obtain and use credentials.

   Often presented using tools like OpenAPI (Swagger) specifications.

6. Code Examples and SDKs:
   Practical code examples in multiple languages to illustrate common use cases.
   Links to official or community-supported SDKs (Software Development Kits).

7. Tutorials and Guides:
   Step-by-step instructions for performing specific tasks or achieving common goals with the API.

8. Rate Limits and Usage Policies:
   Information on request limits and any other usage restrictions.

9. Support and Community:
   Details on how to get support, report issues, or engage with the API's developer community.

Every API endpoint should include:

HTTP Method (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE)
Endpoint URL
Description of what it does
Request Parameters (path, query, body)
Request Headers (authentication, content-type)
Request Body (for POST/PATCH requests)
Response Format (success and error responses)
Status Codes
Examples (request and response)
