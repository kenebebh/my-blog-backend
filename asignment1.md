# Assignment: Build CRUD Endpoints for Users

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

You have already learned how to create **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** endpoints for blog posts.  
Now, your task is to **apply the same knowledge to users**. This will help you practice working with multiple collections and building your backend systems like a pro.

---

## ðŸ“Œ User Schema

Each user should have the following fields:

- `name` (String, required) â†’ the userâ€™s full name
- `email` (String, required, unique) â†’ must be unique for each user
- `password` (String, required) â†’ hashed later, but for now store as plain text (weâ€™ll secure it later)
- `role` (String, default: `"reader"`) â†’ can be `"reader"` or `"author"`
- `createdAt` (Date, default: Date.now)

### Please learn how to validate your schema and how to specify required fields, unique fields,

you can refer to this article for a guide _[https://www.mongodb.com/developer/languages/javascript/getting-started-with-mongodb-and-mongoose/]_
